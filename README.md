# Happy Thoughts a happy version of Twitter 

A Happy Thoughts kind of Twitter, send a message of what makes you happy right now and you or someone else can like it!

This project has been all about using React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API, to a backend which I also build from scratch.

## To build

Run "npm install" 
Run script "npm start"

And here the code is for the API in the backend: https://github.com/TheresaUlwahn/project-happy-thoughts-api

Heroku for the API: https://project-happy-thoughts-api.herokuapp.com/

## What I'm proud of with my code

* The use of APIs in React, firing requests within `useEffect`.
* How I put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page.
* To show my skills in working with an API, which you both send and receive data from.

## What is build

* A form to post new thoughts
* The page lists the most recent thoughts
* Every thought has a heart button to send likes

## Next step
Refactor the code
Move the postrequest from App.js to HappyForm.js
Css can never be enough
