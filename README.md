# Happy Thoughts 

Upon building this site, I was able to practice my React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API, which I also build from scratch using MongoDB and Node.JS.

And here the code is for the API build from scratch in the backend: https://github.com/TheresaUlwahn/project-happy-thoughts-api

Heroku for the API: https://project-happy-thoughts-api.herokuapp.com/

## What I'm proud of with my code

* How to use APIs in React, firing requests within `useEffect`.
* How to put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page.
* What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.

## What is build

* The page follows the design as closely as possible
* The page lists the most recent thoughts
* The page has a form to post new thoughts
* The page has the heart button to send likes on a thought
* Code follows Technigoâ€™s code guidelines.
