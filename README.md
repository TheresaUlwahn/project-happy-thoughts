# Happy Thoughts 

Try the site out here: https://mrsucodesproject11thehappythoughts.netlify.com/
And here the code is for the API build from scratch in the backend: https://github.com/TheresaUlwahn/project-happy-thoughts-api
Link to Heroku for the API: https://project-happy-thoughts-api.herokuapp.com/

Upon building this site, I was able to practice my React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API, which I also build from scratch using MongoDB and Node.JS.

## What I learned 🧠

* How to use APIs in React, firing requests within `useEffect`.
* How to put the result of API responses into React state to show in the page.
* What it's like to work with an API which you both send and receive data from.

## Requirements I reached 🧪

* The page follow the design as closely as possible
* The page lists the most recent thoughts
* The page has a form to post new thoughts
* The page has the heart button to send likes on a thought
* Code follows Technigo’s code guidelines.
